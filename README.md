# SM-DSC-Assignments
[Data Science](https://fagbesk.sam.sdu.dk/?fag_id=38412) course assignments. Contains 3 assignments. Coded in R and Python. Currently there is only a solution for assignment 2 and 3 as the first one was uploaded to another students repository (Private).

# How to run
Assignment 2 can be opened with [R](https://www.r-project.org/)/[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
Assignment 3 can be opened with Python in any editor you prefer (I suggest using [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)).
