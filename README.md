# SM-DSC-Assignments
[Data Science](https://fagbesk.sam.sdu.dk/?fag_id=38412) course assignments. Contains 3 assignments. Coded in R and Python. Currently there is only a solution for assignment 2 and 3 as the first one was uploaded to another students repository (Private).

# About
The three assignments revolved around machine learning. 
### [Assignment 1](https://github.com/Spiderixius/SM-DSC-Assignments/tree/master/AssignmentJurgen)
The first part of assignment 1 was about Boston Housing where the goal was to make use of different algorithms [Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression), [LDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis), and [KNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) to figure out which variables had a great effect on crime rates in the Boston area.
The second part of assignment 1 revolved around using logistic regression to measure students performance, given some conditions. 
### [Assignment 2](https://github.com/Spiderixius/SM-DSC-Assignments/tree/master/AssignmentVictoria)
Assignment 2 was about alcohol related car crashes, where the goal was to fit a logistic regression model to adjusted (using several confounders) and unadjusted models and trying to predict on chances of having an accident when blood alcohol levels are above a certain limit. 
### [Assignment 3](https://github.com/Spiderixius/SM-DSC-Assignments/tree/master/AssignmentEsmail)
Assignment 3 was about image recognition using [transfer learning](http://cs231n.github.io/transfer-learning/) using convolutional neural networks ([CNN](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)). The goal was to train on four artists: Renoir, Manet, Degas and Monet and furthermore only focusing on impresionalism. The data was gathered from [WikiArt](https://www.wikiart.org/) using a small bash script (Viva la laziness!). VGG16 was used as the pretrained network on [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/).
# How to run
Assignment 2 can be opened with [R](https://www.r-project.org/)/[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).
Assignment 3 can be opened with Python in any editor you prefer (I suggest using [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/)).
